# OPL PS2 Game Compatibility List
This is a github repository that contains lists of compatible PS2 games using USB on OPL.

# How to add a game list here?
To add a game to this list, you may refer to this master branch here: https://github.com/ColtonSilvaonKnoxKontor/OPL-Game-Compatibility-List. This page uses static HTML table format instead of simple github markdown processor.
