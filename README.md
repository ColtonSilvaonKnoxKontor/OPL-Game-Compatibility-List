# OPL PS2 Game Compatibility List
This is a github repository that contains updated lists of compatible PS2 games using USB on OPL. For HDD/SMB, refer to other sources. To view this list dynamically, you may click the link to the left section of About.

# How to add a game list here?
You may use `formatter.cpp`, a c++ program that will automatically format a table data for you with easy to input function. These lists follow alphabetical sorting order from first numeric and letter.

> [!NOTE]
> Please put compatibility mode settings or OPL version on **Notes** if there's a specific version that can work while others not.

# Disclaimer
While some data here are not so accurate since most game lists are based on other sources provided by the OPL devs and contributors, it guarantees that all of the listed games here are tested working; or if not,they are reported as not compatible with latest OPL version. You may update or change data here if some features of OPL works or not.

Without game setting mode, only "insufficient memory card" shows. With game setting MODE 4 (Skip Videos), the main menu and inputting player name, gender, birthdate and blood type is accessible but after proceeding to game, it freezes. This is because, in fact that this game is actually a music visual software for the said Japanese pop group.
