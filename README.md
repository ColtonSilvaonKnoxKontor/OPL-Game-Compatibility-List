# OPL PS2 Game Compatibility List
This is a github page that contains lists of compatible PS2 games using USB on OPL.

# How to add a game list here?
To add a game to this list, you may refer to this master branch here: <a href="https://github.com/ColtonSilvaonKnoxKontor/OPL-Game-Compatibility-List">OPL Game Compatibility List Repository Page</a>. This branch is meant for web hosting.

# Notes
You must be using latest version of OPL builds for better game support, although older builds works better in certain games.

# Disclaimer
While some data here are not so accurate since most game lists are based on other sources provided by the OPL devs and contributors, it guarantees that all of the listed games here are tested working; or if not, they are reported as not compatible with latest OPL version. You may update or change data here if some features of OPL works or not.
